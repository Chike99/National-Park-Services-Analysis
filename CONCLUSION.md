## Conclusions

The project was able to make several data visualizations and inferences about the various species in four of the National Parks that comprised this data set.

This project was also able to answer some of the questions first posed in the beginning:
- The vast majority of species were not part of conservation.(5,633 vs 191)
- Mammals and Birds had the highest percentage of being in protection
- The singular most observed specie was a Vascular Plant known as Deep-Root Clubmoss or Ground Cedar (Lycopodium tristachyum)
-
